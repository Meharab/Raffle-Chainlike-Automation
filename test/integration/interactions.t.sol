 * Integration tests - We test our deployment scripts and other components of our contracts
 * Forked tests - Pseudo staging
 * Staging tests - We run tests on a mainnet/testnet
 * Fuzz tests - Randomized inputs to test edge cases
 * Stateful fuzz tests - Randomized inputs with state changes
 * Stateless fuzz tests - Randomized inputs without state changes
 * Formal verification - Mathematical proofs to verify correctness
